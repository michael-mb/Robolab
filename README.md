# RoboLab

![Robot image](<robot.jpg>)

This is a solution to the TU-Dresden RoboLab project from the winter semester 18/19. The lab's task is the development of software components controlling a mobile robot which was tasked with exploring varying targets in a graph network.

Among other functionalities, our solution implements line following motion control, pose estimation via odometry, optimal and heuristic path planning as well as communication with an auxilliary MQTT server.
