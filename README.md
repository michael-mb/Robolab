# RoboLab

![Robot image](<robot.jpg>)

This is a solution to the TU-Dresden RoboLab project from the winter semester 18/19. The lab's task is the development of software components controlling a mobile robot which was tasked with exploring varying targets in a graph network.

Among other functionalities, our solution implements line following motion control, pose estimation via odometry, optimal and heuristic path planning as well as communication with an auxilliary MQTT server.

Template for the RoboLab course in spring which is conducted by the Systems Engineering Group at the Department of Computer Science, TU Dresden.

* Acts as a base repository that groups clone and then set the upstream to their assigned repo afterwards.
* Provides scripts to speed up and automate the process of deploying as well as executing Python code on LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robots running the customized, Debian based operating system.
* Includes the programming interface which is used to check parts of the students solutions in the final exam.
